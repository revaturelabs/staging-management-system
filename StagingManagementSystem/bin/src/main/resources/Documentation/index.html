  <dt>What problem does this project address?</dt>

  resources that are currently in staging and awaiting placement with clients. 
  Additionally, the task of planning the allocation of future resources is also addressed.</dd>


  <dt>What is the goal of this project?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">The goal of this project is to provide a simple and concise system of 
  managing the status of associates as they move from training to staging to placement with 
  clients. Additionally, this project seeks to ease the burden of long-term planning. 
  By offering a resource forecasting functionality, more strategic planning of future resources will be attained.</dd>


  <dt>What is the scope of this project?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">The original concept behind this application was to give a Superuser the means to Add/View/Manage 
  human resources and a Manager user to be able to View/Manage said data. Its purpose is to aid in processing business 
  client requests for staffing and ensuring that associates that are mapped to clients are not accidentally placed with 
  other business clients.</dd>
