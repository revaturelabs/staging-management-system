 <h3>AGILE Scrum</h3>

 <p>This application with the use of Agile in 2 sprints(1 week durations)</p>

 <p>Agile Scrum Development: It is a lightweight project management framework with 
 a broad applicability used to aid in managing and controlling iterative/incremental application development.
For Scrum, the "Product Owner" works closely with a development team to identify 
and prioritize application functionalities in the form of a "Product Backlog" which contain user stories; 
For example: <i>"As a user, I can log in"</i>. This product Backlog contains
 application features, bug fixes, and non-functional requirements. Developers take these user stories and 
 undergo a sprint in which they create an incremental build of the application which 
 lowly takes shape into the final build over multiple sprints. </p>
