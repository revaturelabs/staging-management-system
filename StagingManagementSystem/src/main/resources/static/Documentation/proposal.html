 <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>

 <dl> 

  <dt>What is the setting and history behind this project?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">Originally, human resources such as associates have been mapped exclusively by an Excel sheet.
  The data therein only consisted of those who actively checked in daily and had no way of fortelling how many 
  associates would be available in future weeks. The idea was conceived around May 10th, 2017 when the 
  Product-Owner requested a way to revolutionize the current system.</dd>


  <dt>What is the problem to be addressed?</dt> 
  
  <dd class="sample1">With the idea of overhauling the current system, the web based application should be capable
  of creating and tracking associates throughout the Revature Program with the functionality of pairing Associates with Client Companies.
  By adding this functionality, the use of the prior Excel sheet can be replaced and allows the creation of added functionalities.</dd>


  <dt>What are some current approaches to this problem?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">The end user can log associates into an excel sheet to record daily attendance. Later, 
  this prior functionality was built upon by allowing associates to log in daily in order to record attendance.
  </dd>


  <dt>Why is this problem worth solving or worth solving better?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">At the prior stages there were no way to properly track Associate pairings 
  with Client Companies, which in turn would create problems if an associate was placed with a different 
  Client Company if they were already reserved for another. </dd>


  <dt>How will this product be better than previous approaches?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">Our approach is aimed at providing a relevant and interactive view that can aid in dynamic allocation of human resources.
  In development, the main focus was to be able to view the total number of current and future associates; while providing a way to map them to clients if they are available.</dd>
  
  <dd class="sample2">Our system will have enhanced functionality, better maintainability, scalability, and security.</dd>

 <div id="goal">
 <h3>Goal</h3>
 <dl>

  <dt>What is the goal of this project?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">This project will produce an interactive web application 
  that allows end users to create/view/update associate, batch, and client information</dd>
 
 
  <dt>What are the defining features and benefits of this product?</dt>
 
  <dd>
  <ul class="sample1">
   <li>Reusable web application with functionality for creating,
   editing, deleting, searching, and assigning associates/batches/clients. 
   This maintains and refreshes to ensure that users will always find 
   information that is automatically up-to-date.</li>
 
   <li>The web application will be secure and only allow users with the
   proper permissions access.  This will prevent the addition, modification, and removal of information.</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>

 <div id="scope">
 <h3>Scope</h3>
 
 <p class="sample1">We want to focus on the web application itself,
 and the features of that application that help create a means of providing a coherent view of current and future associate data.</p>

 <ul class="sample3">
  <li>Work with Apache Tomcat</li>
  <li>Develop with Spring and Hibernate
  <li>The web site provides ways for a user to change the status and linking of an Associate to a Client.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Risks and Rewards</h3>
 <dl>

  <dt>What are the main risks of this project?</dt>
 
  <dd class="sample1">
   <ol>
  
    <li>There are significant technical difficulties in building a web
	application using the advanced technologies such as: AngularJS, Spring, Hibernate, etc..
	This will be a risk because it is an initial approach to AngularJS development.
	We will certainly make some mistakes and suboptimal choices. However that may be, we will address this
    risk by scoping the project such that we have enough time to train
    and to review the design and implementation.</li>
  
    <li>The schedule for this project is very short.  We will manage
    this by planning a conservatively scoped functional core and series
    of incremental builds in which can implement added functionalities for future iterations..</li>
   </ol>
  </dd>

 
  <dt>What are the main rewards if this project succeeds?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">If we accomplish the elements of our plan, our
  Staging Management System will replace the relic Excel sheet and provide a 
  more modern approach to the problem.</dd>
